# redux setup

This setup follows [the example](
https://codesandbox.io/s/9on71rvnyo) provided by `react-redux` official docs.

The only difference is the addition of the app's `Provider` component, that helps
keep the `App` component a bit cleaner.

Actions should follow the [Flux Standard Actions](
https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action#flux-standard-action) convention.
