# redux setup

This setup starts with [the example](https://codesandbox.io/s/9on71rvnyo) provided by `react-redux` official docs.

Logic is factored into 3 parts, the app (main), audio, and router.

Redux-dev-middleware and redux-thunk are added.

Actions should follow the [Flux Standard Actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action#flux-standard-action) convention.
